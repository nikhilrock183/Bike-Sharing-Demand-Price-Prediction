# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Price-Prediction

Bike sharing demand price prediction is a task that involves using machine learning techniques to forecast the demand for bike rentals and predict the prices associated with bike sharing services. This type of prediction can be valuable for bike sharing companies to optimize their operations, manage resources efficiently, and offer competitive pricing to their customers. Here's an overview of the steps involved in bike sharing demand price prediction:

Data Collection: Gather the bike sharing dataset, which should include features such as date/time, weather conditions, holiday indicators, and historical demand data. The dataset should also include the target variable, which is the bike sharing demand price.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Perform feature engineering, which may involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Visualize relationships between variables and identify any patterns or trends that may be useful for prediction.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Select relevant features that have a significant impact on the bike sharing demand price. This can be done through statistical analysis or by using feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis or feature importance from machine learning models.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for price prediction. Commonly used algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. Consider the strengths and limitations of each algorithm and select the one that best suits the dataset and the problem at hand.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected machine learning model using the training dataset. The model will learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the bike sharing demand price.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset. Use evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared to assess the model's performance. Analyze the results and fine-tune the model if necessary.
